Elementary can send alerts about:

- Failures and/or of dbt tests
- Failures and/or Elementary tests
- Model runs failures
- Source freshness issues

The alerts can be sent to Slack or Microsoft Teams, and we are working on adding more channels.

You can enrich your alerts by adding properties to tests and models in your `.yml` files.
The supported attributes are: owner, subscribers, description, tags.

You can configure and customize your alerts by configuring:
custom channel, suppression interval, alert fields (for test alerts only), alert grouping, alert filters.
